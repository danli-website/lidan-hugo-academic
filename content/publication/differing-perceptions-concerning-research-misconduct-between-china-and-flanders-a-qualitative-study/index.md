abstract: In the field of research integrity, there has been increasing interest
  in the influence of culture on research misconduct. Yet, there is a lack of
  empirical study on how differently researchers from distinct cultural
  backgrounds perceive research misconduct. Hence, we used the qualitative
  approach to investigate and compare perspectives concerning research
  misconduct between Chinese and Flemish researchers. By means of 45 interviews
  we explored their perspectives on types, determinants of, and solutions to
  research misconduct. Our findings show elements of scientific culture shared
  by both groups, but also clear dissimilarities. The Chinese participants more
  often mentioned plagiarism and inappropriate authorship as examples of
  research misconduct, while Flemish respondents brought up fabrication and
  falsification. Research misconduct was associated with diverse determinants,
  though the Chinese favored the “bad apple” theory (more intrinsic), while the
  Flemish pointed to the “publish or perish” pressure and attributed misconduct
  to situational aspects (rather extrinsic). Accordingly, they proposed diverse
  strategies to handle this issue, yet education and training were recommended
  by both groups. This study confirms that research misconduct is the result of
  many factors intertwining and interacting, and suggests that cultural traits
  contribute to our perceptions of research misconduct and subsequent bias in
  that context.
