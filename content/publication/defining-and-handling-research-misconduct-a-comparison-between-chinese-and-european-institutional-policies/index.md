abstract: Research institutions are responsible for promoting research integrity
  and handling allegations of research misconduct. Due to various cultural and
  social contexts, institutional policies from different cultural backgrounds
  exhibit many differences, such as their primary concern and mechanisms for
  dealing with allegations of research misconduct. This comparative study
  analyses research misconduct policies from 21 Chinese and 22 European
  universities. The results show that definitions of research misconduct from
  all retrieved policies go beyond fabrication, falsification, and plagiarism
  but include different types of questionable research practices. Their
  procedures for handling research misconduct differ in, for example,
  confidentiality and disclosure of conflict of interest. Differences can also
  be found in their governance approaches (“bottom-up” versus “top-down”).
