abstract: China has achieved a dramatic development in scientific research over
  the last few decades. However, just like many other countries, it has also
  seen a surge of scientific misconducts. With its expansion of international
  publications, retractions due to suspected research misconduct are also on the
  rise. A transcultural case study was conducted by investigating the perception
  of research misbehaviors by Chinese researchers compared to their Belgian
  Flemish colleagues. The study was designed to find out variation in research
  practices in different countries and to see how research was shaped and
  influenced by cultural contexts. An online questionnaire was sent to 3,236
  researchers by e-mails and it received a response rate of 13.09%. They were
  asked to score 32 research misbehaviors on a 5-point scale. The findings
  suggested that compared to Flemish respondents, the Chinese had a
  significantly higher acceptance toward most research misbehaviors. To be more
  specific, the Chinese respondents felt less unacceptable toward behaviors
  violating such values as honesty, fairness, and verifiability than the
  Flemish, while their perceptions of behaviors that violated such values as
  responsibility, objectivity, and truth were not different compared to the
  Flemish. This case study implies that the Chinese research community is in an
  urgent need of training in responsible conduct of research and strong as well
  as sound guidelines for responsible research practices in place.
